In essence, REST defines what your API should look like, while NestJS provides the tools and structure
to build it efficiently with enterprise-grade
features like dependency injection, testing frameworks, and scalable architecture patterns.

            Key Differences
Aspect	REST	                                                            NestJS
Type	Architectural pattern	                                        Development framework
Purpose	Defines API design principles	                                Provides development tools and structure
Implementation	Can be implemented in any language/framework	        Specific to Node.js/TypeScript
Scope	API design methodology	                                        Full application development platform
State Management	Stateless by design	                                Framework handles state through dependency injection


REST: The Rules of the Game
Think of REST as the "grammar" of web APIs. It's not code you install
- it's a set of conventions that make your APIs predictable and intuitive:
text
GET /api/users          # Get all users
GET /api/users/123      # Get specific user
POST /api/users         # Create new user
PUT /api/users/123      # Update entire user
PATCH /api/users/123    # Partial update
DELETE /api/users/123   # Remove user

What I love about REST:
Predictable: Once you know REST, any well-designed API feels familiar
HTTP-native: Leverages what HTTP already gives us (status codes, methods, headers)
Cacheable: GET requests can be cached naturally
Language agnostic: Works with Python Flask, Java Spring, Node Express, whatever


NestJS: The Developer Experience Framework

Why I choose NestJS for serious projects:
Dependency Injection: No more manually wiring dependencies or singleton hell
TypeScript-first: Catch errors at compile time, not in production
Modular by design: Code organization that scales with team size
Decorator magic: Less boilerplate, more expressiveness
Enterprise-ready: Built-in support for testing, logging, validation, auth


Here's what actually happens in practice:
Small project or prototype? I'll grab Express and build a REST API in 30 minutes
Production app with a team? NestJS every time

Bottom Line
REST = The architectural style that makes your API intuitive
NestJS = The framework that makes building REST APIs (or GraphQL) a joy
